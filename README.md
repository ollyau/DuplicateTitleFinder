Duplicate Title Finder
====================

A utility to find SimObjects with the same title in Flight Simulator.

Usage
---

Simply launch DuplicateTitleFinder.exe and it will display either a list of duplicate titles and their associated cfg files or a message that no duplicates were found.  If you want to check a specific simulator, you can use the following command line syntax:

    DuplicateTitleFinder.exe -sim:value

Where value is one of FSX, ESP, P3D, or P3D2.  If you launch Duplicate Title Finder without any arguments it will default to all installed simulators.
